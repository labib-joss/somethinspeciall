    <p>I don’t even know where to start…</p>
    <p>It was back in the late days of Class 7. I was just scrolling on Instagram when I got a notification — a follow request. Out of curiosity, I checked… and it was **you**.</p>
    <p>I saw your profile picture — and it hit different. It felt like **that song**, “She looks just like a dream,” was written for that moment.</p>
    <p>You looked different. You looked… beautiful.</p>
    <p>I even told a friend about you. He told me your name — and from that day, something began. I’m not a stalker, promise 😅… but somehow, my eyes would always find you.</p>
    <p>That feeling grew through Class 8 and into 9. I don’t know why, but I think I became obsessed — not in a bad way, but because I admired you deeply.</p>
    <p>Still, I never approached you. I didn’t want to disturb you or make things awkward.</p>
    <p>But one day, a friend tricked me — sent me a link and got me to write your name. That’s how the letters started. I know it might’ve been uncomfortable.</p>
    <p>I never meant it. When we finally talked… I was nervous, anxious, and too excited. I said silly things and it got awkward—and then you ghosted me.</p>
    <p>But I had predicted it.</p>
    <p>Still, I’m grateful. You’re someone I’ll always remember — not because it was dramatic, but because you made even quiet moments feel special.</p>
